# C# Mini Projects

Welcome to the C# Mini Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of small C# projects, organized into different categories that showcase the versatility of the C# language.

This repository serves as a learning tool for my journey with C#. The projects range from simple console applications to more complex desktop, web, and game applications, allowing for progressive improvement in coding skills while keeping the learning process enjoyable.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following top-level folders:

- **1_ConsoleApps**: Simple command-line applications to practice fundamental C# concepts.
- **2_DesktopApps**: Projects involving desktop applications using frameworks like Windows Forms and WPF.
- **3_WebApps**: Web development projects using ASP.NET Core, including MVC and API-based applications.
- **4_MobileApps**: Cross-platform mobile applications built using Xamarin or .NET MAUI.
- **4_Games**: Game development projects using Unity and C# scripting.
- **5_Libraries**: Custom libraries or reusable components, such as helper utilities or service classes.
- **6_DataAccess**: Projects demonstrating database interactions using Entity Framework, LINQ, and SQL Server.
